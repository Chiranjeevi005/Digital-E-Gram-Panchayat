## Project Overview

The Digital E-Panchayat system is a full-stack web application built with Next.js that enables village-level citizen services. Users can apply for various services, track their applications, and download approved documents in PDF or JPG format - all completely free of charge.

The system provides a digital platform for citizens to access government services online, eliminating the need for physical visits to government offices. It implements role-based access control with three distinct user roles: Citizen, Staff, and Officer, each with different levels of access and functionality.

## Key Features

### Service Management
- Browse available services with search and filtering capabilities
- View service details including requirements and processing time
- Apply for services through dedicated application forms

### Application Processing
- Submit applications with form data
- Track application status (pending, in-progress, approved, rejected)
- Automatic approval for free services with immediate processing

## Security Measures

### Authentication Security
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- Strong password policy enforcement for Admin and Staff roles
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks (5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP)
- Account lockout after configurable failed attempts
- Exponential backoff and CAPTCHA after failed attempts

### Authorization Framework
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with three distinct roles
- Server-side middleware enforcing role-based access
- Fine-grained access control with default deny policy
- Centralized permission management

### Data Protection
- Environment variables for all secrets
- MongoDB schema validation
- Input sanitization using Zod
- Secure password storage
- Email verification for local accounts

### Transport Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Content Security Policy headers
- XSS and CSRF protection

### Session Management
- JWT-based sessions with role claims
- Secure HttpOnly cookies with SameSite attributes
- 30-day session expiration
- Automatic session cleanup

### File Security
- File type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG only)
- File size limits (5MB maximum)
- Server-side virus scanning (placeholder for ClamAV integration)
- Signed URLs for downloads with short expiration

### OAuth Integration Security
- Google Sign-In exclusively for citizens
- Role restriction (Admin/Staff prohibited from Google Sign-In)
- Automatic role assignment for Google users
- Secure token handling

## User Roles and Authentication

### Role Hierarchy
1. Officer (Highest)
2. Staff
3. Citizen (Lowest)

### Role Permissions
| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| Officer | Full access to all system features, including user management, service management, and system analytics |
| Staff | Access to service management, citizen record updates, and reports |
| Citizen | Access to apply for services, view application status, and manage personal information |

### Authentication Methods
1. Traditional Login/Register (All Roles)
   - Email + Password authentication
   - Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
   - Strong password policy enforcement for Admin and Staff roles

2. Google Sign-In (Citizens Only)
   - Integrated with NextAuth.js
   - Available only for Citizen role
   - Admin and Staff roles cannot use Google Sign-In
